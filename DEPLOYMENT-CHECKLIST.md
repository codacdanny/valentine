## 🆘 Emergency Fixes

If something breaks right before showing her:

1. **Photos not showing?**
   - Quickly refresh the page
   - Check file names in public/photos/
   - Use upload feature during demo

2. **Music not playing?**
   - Skip it - visuals are amazing anyway!
   - Mention it's "interactive" and she can turn it on

3. **Page won't load?**
   - Refresh browser
   - Restart dev server
   - Show her on different device

4. **Wrong date showing?**
   - Laugh it off as a test
   - Tell her you'll fix it later
   - Focus on the sentiment

## 💖 Remember

The app is amazing, but what matters most is:
- The thought you put in
- The effort you made
- The love you're showing
- Your genuine feelings

She'll love it because YOU made it for HER. 💕
